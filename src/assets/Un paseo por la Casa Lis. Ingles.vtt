00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.900
Good afternoon, I'm John Garcia Paino,

2
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.140
president of the Association
of Friends of the Casa Lis Museum.

3
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.420
First of all,

4
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.320
thank you to the FEAN
for counting on us to expose this

5
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.560
little video
presentation for the rest

6
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.560
of the associations are part
of the Federation of Friends of.

7
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.680
And as a picture of our house.

8
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.980
LiS is worth more than many words than me
I say and I'm going to continue telling something.

9
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.780
But at the same time we are going to introduce ourselves
some of the pictures

10
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.920
that are part of this house, this corner
so beautiful that we have here in Salamanca.

eleven
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.360
First of all,
after this little presentation,

12
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.800
I will tell you that the Lis house, the association
that we form in the course of the house.

13
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.360
Lis was already born in 2004.

14
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.820
We have 26 years ahead of us,

fifteen
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.780
which has allowed us to evolve to
the time the museum has evolved.

16
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.520
And today this is one
of modernist museums.

17
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.850
As you know, from Art Nueveau, Art Deco

18
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.540
one of the most visited in Castilla y LeÃ³n
in our main activity,

19
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.570
that has always been promoting culture
in Salamanca and therefore,

twenty
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.760
through our Casa Lis Museum
we collaborate closely and also

twenty-one
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.660
in a very harmonious way with our
museum director with his team

22
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.290
and with all the staff who work in
a strange place, growing as you see.

23
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.560
And now the association
is an association that we can say

24
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.680
that we are in a very
stable, with more than 999 members

25
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.580
and in these moments that we have spent
of confinement

26
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.880
have been difficult times
because we were used to

27
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.260
to a continuous activity
of plays, of different operas,

28
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.880
that we made practically two,
three times a month presenting books

29
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.940
in this room where we are,
which is the room of the columns.

30
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.240
And in this time of confinement,

31
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.020
Well, the way we've had to be
Contact with our partners has been through emails.

32
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.500
Where in addition to sending you links
of cultural interest, we give.

33
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.680
We have sent a message of encouragement
and patience, especially so that it passes

3. 4
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.880
this pandemic situation
and so that we can return to our

35
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.500
normal situation
that we had before

36
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.300
We believe that everything is happening

37
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.100
hopefully in a few months we will return
to that normal situation.

38
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.740
And we see the future with enthusiasm and with
I really want to continue collaborating

39
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.680
with the museum in all the activities it does
and keep the activity going.

40
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.440
I encourage you this summer,

41
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.560
it's going to be a summer
a little strange in terms of holidays,

42
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.320
because we are going to have
pass them on nationally when we can

43
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.100
pass provinces,
from other provinces to others.

44
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.260
I invite you to visit those that do not
know our house Lis

Four. Five
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.660
and to those who have already come too,
because every time we are changing.

46
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.860
That is, the house is dynamic

47
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.680
Apart from its permanent exhibitions,
we have temporary exhibitions now,

48
00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.860
an interesting flamenco painting
and we always have something new to teach.

49
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.800
So thank you for your

fifty
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.160
attention and we want to see you here
any day to visit us.
